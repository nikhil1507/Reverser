# Reverser

Welcome to the **Reverser**, a retro snake game but with a twist. This application is not just a nostalgic throwback to the classic snake game but also serves as an educational tool to visualize the algorithm for reversing a linked list. Built with **React.js**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**, this project combines fun gameplay with a deep dive into data structures.

## Features

- 🎮 Classic retro snake gameplay with smooth animations.
- 📊 Visual representation of the linked list before and after reversal.
- 🖥️ Interactive UI built with React.js.
- 🎨 Custom CSS styling for a nostalgic look and feel.
- 📚 Educational insights into data structures and algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic and game mechanics.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the game graphics.
